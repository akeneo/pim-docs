Upgrade Akeneo PIM projects
===========================

.. note::
    If you would like to migrate from an On Premise or Flexibility (PaaS) instance to a Serenity (SaaS) one, please see our guide here: :doc:`./migrate_to_saas`

This chapter describes how to apply a patch on your current version or how to upgrade from a major version to a more recent one.

As a prerequisite, we assume that you are using a project installed from a Community Edition or an Enterprise Edition (:doc:`/install_pim/index`).
