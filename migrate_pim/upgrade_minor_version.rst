How to upgrade to a minor version? (PIM version < 4.x)
======================================================


.. note::

    Since version 5.0, we have stopped releasing minor versions. Instead, we release more frequent, smaller patches. Instructions for installing patches can be found here: :doc:`/migrate_pim/apply_patch/index`


Since 1.x to 3.x, we released a minor version 3 times a year:

* the X.1 (STS: Short Term Support version)
* the X.2 (also a STS - Short Term Support - version)
* the X.3 (LTS: Long Term Support version)

These versions bring new features.

Depending on these features and on the custom code you've added in your project, the migration can be more or less straightforward.

Each minor release was provided with a migration guide and a set of scripts to automate it as much as possible.

Here are the migration guides:
