How to upgrade to a minor version?
==================================

We release a minor version 3 times a year:

* the X.1 (STS: Short Term Support version)
* the X.2 (also a STS - Short Term Support - version)
* the X.3 (LTS: Long Term Support version)

These versions bring new features.

Depending on these features and on the custom code you've added in your project, the migration can be more or less straightforward.

Each release is provided with a migration guide and a set of scripts to automate it as much as possible.

We continue to improve this process to make every new migration easier than the previous one.

Here are the migration guides:
