How to upgrade to a major version?
==================================

We release a major version each year.
These new major versions bring new features and larger changes to answer clients growing needs.

Upgrade from 1.7 to 2.0
-----------------------

To migrate from 1.7 to 2.0, we recommend the use of our migration tool `Transporteo`_.

.. _Transporteo: https://github.com/akeneo/transporteo

Upgrade from 2.3 to 3.1
-----------------------

To migrate from 2.0 to 3.1 version, it is necessary to do the progressively upgrade process to each 2.X version.

For instance, if you are on the 2.0 version, you will have to migrate to the 2.1, then the 2.2 and finally the 2.3.

From the 2.3 version, you will be able to follow this migration guide:

**If you are a Community Edition user**

* `From v2.3 to v3.0`_
* `From v3.0 to v3.1`_
* `From v3.1 to v3.2`_
