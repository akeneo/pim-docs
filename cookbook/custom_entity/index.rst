How to Create a Custom Entity and Use it as a Product Attribute
===============================================================

Why Create a Custom Entity ?
----------------------------

In some cases, you may need to manage different entities than the one natively
provided by Akeneo and link them to the products.

.. note::

    if you do not need to use your custom entity as a product attribute, follow
    only the first part of this cookbook's recipe.

For example, let's say we want to create a more advanced manufacturer entity
than using a standard attribute option, because the manufacturer needs
specific attribute itself like the manufacturing country.
