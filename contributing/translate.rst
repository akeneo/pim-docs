Translate the PIM
=================

We use `Crowdin`_ to translate the PIM.

When a new translation key is added in the code of the PIM, this key is sent to Crowdin.

Keys are translated by contributors, then validated by proof readers.

Each week, we download validated translations from Crowdin to update the PIM.

We deliver the new translations in the next patch for each versions.

Don't hesitate to create an account and begin to translate on: http://crowdin.net/project/akeneo

If your language is not enabled don't hesitate to ask, we'll enable it with pleasure.
