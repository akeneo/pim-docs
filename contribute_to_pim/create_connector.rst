How to contribute to a Connector?
=================================

We're happy to connect the PIM to any third-party system!

* Begin by checking on the `Akeneo PIM Marketplace`_ that nobody published a connector for a 3rd party system
* Create your connector :doc:`/import_and_export_data/guides/create-connector`
* Reference it on the `Akeneo PIM Marketplace`_
