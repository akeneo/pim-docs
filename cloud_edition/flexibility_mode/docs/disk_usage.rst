Disk Usage
==========

Introduction
------------
Each Flexibility instance has got its own dedicated disk.

Storage space depends on the contract, which usually starts as follow:

- 350GB for a production instance
- 150GB for a sandbox instance

Because each disk is dedicated to only one instance, the storage space of one instance cannot be shared with another instance.

Usages Impacting Disk Usage
---------------------------
The disk usage will inscrease following the lifecycle of the instance. For example, each time:

- a new product / family / ... is created  

  + entries are created in database
  
- a product / family / ... is modified 

  + previous version is stored in versioning table
  + by default, old versions are kept forever (as of v3.2.7)
  
- an asset is uploaded  

  + it is stored on the file system
  + if the asset is replaced with a new one, the old version stays on disk
  
- an import / export runs  
  
  + it creates an archive
  + by default, those archived are retained during 180 days (as of v3.2.7)
  
- a file is uploaded using SFTP / scp / ...
  
Impact of Disk Usage on the PIM
-------------------------------
When the disk is full, the PIM cannot work anymore: it cannot save modifications in database, upload new asset, ...

It can even prevent ElasticSearch from updating its indexes, resulting in divergence with the database.
To avoid those issues, ensuring a healthy disk usage is necessary.

Improving Disk Usage
--------------------
To reduce disk usage, some temporary files are deleted automatically on a regular basis. For example:

- old temporary import/export files
- old temporary file storage
- akeneo_batch directories
- ansible temporary directories

Moreover, the integrator can:

- activate the purge of old versions of products
- remove assets that are not linked to any product anymore

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p /home/akeneo/purge
    
    echo "Track assets that will be deleted in a csv file"
    mysql akeneo_pim -e "SELECT fi.id, fi.original_filename, fi.file_key, r.file_info_id, r.asset_id, v.* FROM akeneo_file_storage_file_info fi LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_reference r ON fi.id = r.file_info_id LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_variation v ON fi.id = v.file_info_id WHERE storage = 'assetStorage' AND r.file_info_id IS NULL AND r.asset_id IS NULL AND v.source_file_info_id IS NULL" > /home/akeneo/purge/asset_rows_to_delete.csv
  
    echo "List files to be deleted in a txt file"
    echo "Path of files to be deleted is calculated by concatenating "/home/akeneo/pim/app/file_storage/asset/" with value of "fi.file_key" from the MySQL resquest."
    mysql akeneo_pim -se "SELECT concat('/home/akeneo/pim/app/file_storage/asset/',fi.file_key) FROM akeneo_file_storage_file_info fi LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_reference r ON fi.id = r.file_info_id LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_variation v ON fi.id = v.file_info_id WHERE storage = 'assetStorage' AND r.file_info_id IS NULL AND r.asset_id IS NULL AND v.source_file_info_id IS NULL" > /home/akeneo/purge/asset_files_to_delete.txt
  
    echo "Delete rows in database"
    mysql akeneo_pim -se "SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;DELETE v, r, fi FROM akeneo_file_storage_file_info fi LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_reference r ON fi.id = r.file_info_id LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_variation v ON fi.id = v.file_info_id WHERE storage = 'assetStorage' AND r.file_info_id IS NULL AND r.asset_id IS NULL AND v.source_file_info_id IS NULL;SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;" > /home/akeneo/purge/asset_rows_deleted.csv
  
    echo "Delete assets files based on previous list"
    cat /home/akeneo/purge/asset_files_to_delete.txt | xargs rm -f
    

- purge old versions from versioning table

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "Check pim_versioning_version table size"
    mysql akeneo_pim -e 'SELECT table_name AS `Table`, round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024), 2) `Size in GB` FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE table_schema = "akeneo_pim" AND table_name = "pim_versioning_version";'
  


.. warning::

    **Warning:** `mysqlcheck --optimize` will duplicate the table(s) before optimizing it (them). Which means that, before running the command, one must make sure that the remaining free space is at least equals to the biggest table size. To avoid any data loss, backing the tables up before running `mysqlcheck` is prefered. For more information: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqlcheck.html


.. warning::

    **Warning:** `mysqlcheck --optimize` will lock the table during the operation. Hence the table will be unavailable for the PIM. For more information: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqlcheck.html


.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p /home/akeneo/purge
    
    echo "Cleansing versions older than 90 days"
    nohup php bin/console --env=prod pim:versioning:purge --more-than-days 90 --force -n &
    
    echo "Shrink MySQL tables"
    nohup mysqlcheck --optimize akeneo_pim pim_versioning_version &

    
Moreover, the customer and the integrator can:

- open a ticket to ask the Cloud Team to set the duration of retention of archives of import / export
- contact the Customer Success Manager to upscale the disk
