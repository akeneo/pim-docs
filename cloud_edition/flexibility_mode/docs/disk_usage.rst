Disk Usage Management
=====================

A disk is dedicated to a single instance.
As a consequence, a disk cannot be shared between production and sandbox instances.

Usages Impacting Disk Usage
---------------------------

The disk usage will increase following the lifecycle of the instance. For example, each time:

- a new product / family / ... is created

  + entries are created in database

- a product / family / ... is modified

  + previous version is stored in versioning table
  + by default, old versions are kept forever (as of v3.2.7)

- an asset is uploaded

  + it is stored on the file system
  + if the asset is replaced with a new one, the old version stays on disk

- an import / export runs

  + it creates an archive
  + by default, those archives are retained during 180 days

- a file is uploaded using SFTP / scp / ...

Impact of Disk Usage on the PIM
-------------------------------
When the disk is full, the PIM cannot work anymore: it cannot save modifications in database, upload new assets, ...

It can even prevent ElasticSearch from updating its indexes, resulting in desynchronization with the database.
To avoid those issues, ensuring a healthy disk usage is necessary.

Improving Disk Usage
--------------------
To reduce disk usage, some temporary files are deleted automatically on a regular basis. For example:

- old temporary import/export files
- old temporary file storage
- akeneo_batch directories
- ansible temporary directories

Moreover, the integrator can:

- activate the purge of old versions of products
- remove assets that are not linked to any product anymore


Database purges
---------------

Assets
~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p /home/akeneo/purge

    echo "Track assets that will be deleted in a csv file"
    mysql akeneo_pim -e "SELECT fi.id, fi.original_filename, fi.file_key, r.file_info_id, r.asset_id, v.* FROM akeneo_file_storage_file_info fi LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_reference r ON fi.id = r.file_info_id LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_variation v ON fi.id = v.file_info_id WHERE storage = 'assetStorage' AND r.file_info_id IS NULL AND r.asset_id IS NULL AND v.source_file_info_id IS NULL" > /home/akeneo/purge/asset_rows_to_delete.csv

    echo "List files to be deleted in a txt file"
    echo "Path of files to be deleted is calculated by concatenating "/home/akeneo/pim/app/file_storage/asset/" with value of "fi.file_key" from the MySQL resquest."
    mysql akeneo_pim -se "SELECT concat('/home/akeneo/pim/app/file_storage/asset/',fi.file_key) FROM akeneo_file_storage_file_info fi LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_reference r ON fi.id = r.file_info_id LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_variation v ON fi.id = v.file_info_id WHERE storage = 'assetStorage' AND r.file_info_id IS NULL AND r.asset_id IS NULL AND v.source_file_info_id IS NULL" > /home/akeneo/purge/asset_files_to_delete.txt

    echo "Delete rows in database"
    mysql akeneo_pim -se "SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;DELETE v, r, fi FROM akeneo_file_storage_file_info fi LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_reference r ON fi.id = r.file_info_id LEFT JOIN pimee_product_asset_variation v ON fi.id = v.file_info_id WHERE storage = 'assetStorage' AND r.file_info_id IS NULL AND r.asset_id IS NULL AND v.source_file_info_id IS NULL;SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;" > /home/akeneo/purge/asset_rows_deleted.csv

    echo "Delete assets files based on the previous list"
    cat /home/akeneo/purge/asset_files_to_delete.txt | xargs rm -f

.. warning::

    **Warning:** `mysqlcheck --optimize` will lock the table during the operation. Hence the table will be unavailable for the PIM. For more information: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqlcheck.html


Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "Cleaning versions older than 90 days. Please note that this is executed every Sunday by default"
    nohup php bin/console pim:versioning:purge --more-than-days 90 --force -n &

Daily purge of versioning will ensure that the versioning table size does not grow indefinitely.

If the table has grown too much, running the purge won't return the physical space on the disk as it only frees space in the table.
In that case, use the following procedure to free the associated disk space:

.. code-block:: bash

    screen # create a dedicated session you can reconnect to if the connection is lost

    mkdir -p /home/akeneo/purge
    cd /home/akeneo/purge

    mysqldump akeneo_pim pim_versioning_version --add-drop-table |
    gzip -9 > pim_versioning_version.sql.gz

    gunzip < pim_versioning_version.sql.gz | mysql

   # if the connection is lost in the process, re-connect using SSH and run
   screen -r

Moreover, the customer and the integrator can:

- open a ticket to ask the Cloud Team to set the duration of retention of archives of import / export
- contact the Customer Success Manager to upscale the disk

Configure the PIM to save disk space
------------------------------------

- For product exports, you can disable files and media export (Export Profile > Edit > Global Settings)
- Files generated for exports are archived and can increase disk usage rapidly if executed too many times without a purge.
