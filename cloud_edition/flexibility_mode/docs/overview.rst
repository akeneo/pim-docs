To start, you need to set up your flexibility instances from the `Portal <https://help.akeneo.com/portal/articles/set-up-akeneo-flexibility.html?utm_source=akeneo-docs&utm_campaign=flexibility_overview>`_

Akeneo Cloud Flexibility provides 2 environments:

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| The **production** environment:      | my-project.cloud.akeneo.com          |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| The **sandbox** environment:         | my-project-staging.cloud.akeneo.com  |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

Akeneo provides to the system integrator SSH access to both environments.

.. warning::

    **Warning:** Only the production environment is backuped. All data produced on the sandbox environment are not backed up.

.. note::
    **Note:** my-project needs to be replaced by your actual project name.
