System Components
=================

| The system components are based on the :doc:`../../../install_pim/manual/system_requirements/system_requirements`.
|
| Depending on the project technical stack, you may see some additional services, like Elasticsearch or wkhtml2pdf (in case of usage of PIM2Catalog by Naolis).
| If you need specific system components, please contact the Akeneo Cloud team.
