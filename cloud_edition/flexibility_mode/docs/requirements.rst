To get access to the environments, you need to follow this procedure:

#. Create a new cloud ticket to the support with following items :

    - Name of your Akeneo Cloud Project (i.e. <my-project>)
    - List of the SSH keys owners on the Partners Portal, and for each key the environment you want to provide access to (you may not want to give access to the production environment to everybody)
    - List of IP addresses from where the SSH communication will take place
