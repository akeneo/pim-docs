PIM Updates and Migrations
==========================

As the Serenity offer is designed with simplicity in mind, you don't have to do anything to
benefit from the latest patches and releases. The Akeneo team will take care of the upgrades
as quickly as possible.

You will get the latest stable version available.

What delay should I expect ?
----------------------------

As we have to balance between service availability, new features and stability, we might
intentionally delay an update to deliver the best user experience. That being said we do our best
to deliver every patch in a matter of days.

What about downtime ?
---------------------

As the PIM can sometimes contain a lot of data, some upgrades may require a downtime. In those
cases we will contact you directly to find the best maintenance time schedule for you.
