More than 100k products to export?
----------------------------------

In the past, we encountered use cases where partners would export 270k products and experienced issues with the memory usage.

Most of PIM's massive operations, such as imports and exports, process the products iteratively via a size configured subsets of products in order to minimize the memory usage.

As each product may have different properties, the export operation would keep the transformed array in memory in order to add missing columns from one line to another.

In version 1.5.0, we changed the internal behavior of the CsvProductWriter to use a file buffer to temporarily write each previously transformed array in order to aggregate the final result. We decoupled the CsvProductWriter and the buffer component so that it can be used in other contexts.

As a conclusion, the main product export's limitation is now the hard drive space and no longer the available memory.

Please notice that the number of values per product will have an impact on the execution time and memory usage.
