More than 10k families?
-----------------------

The number of families will impact performances of the PIM in several ways.
We've tested performances with a set of 10k families in total.

.. warning::

    We've already improved different screens and processes but we are still experiencing different issues with 10k families and a low amount of attributes and categories.

    The impacted screens are the following:
      - **[TODO]** (PIM-5234) creation of a channel due to the creation of families requirements (Community Edition)

    **If you plan to use the PIM with more than 10k families, please contact us.**
