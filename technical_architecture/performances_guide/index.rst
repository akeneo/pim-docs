Performances Guide
==================

Your product catalog is unique, with different amount of attributes, families, locales, channels, products, etc. All those different combinations may cause different performance issues.

The following chapter explains the different performances bottlenecks you can encounter by using *Akeneo PIM* and lists known issues. It also explains best practices you should implement to ensure the success of your project.

Thank you to contact us when your use case is not covered, we could handle it in next minor version or provide an alternative solution for your project.
