How to Localize your data
=========================

Since the 1.5 version, Akeneo PIM can be used simultaneously by people of different languages in the same installation.
This implies that it is necessary to manage language-related specificities.
For example, the English decimal separator is a dot (.), the French one is a comma (,).
The Akeneo PIM needs to be able to normalize and present this data.

You will find in this chapter the cookbooks to add custom languages, normalizers and presenters.
