Scopable labels
===============

In the case of product export, all localized and/or scopable labels follow the same rule in the import/export:

{code}-{scope}-{locale}

Thus, a `foo` label available in ecommerce and print channels and in fr_FR, en_US and de_DE locales
will be exported in six columns:
- foo-fr_FR-ecommerce
- foo-en_US-ecommerce
- foo-de_DE-ecommerce
- foo-fr_FR-print
- foo-en_US-print
- foo-de_DE-print
