Import / Export
===============

This chapter describes the architecture and behaviour of imports and exports in your Akeneo PIM project.

.. note::

  The import part has been widely re-worked in 1.4: a new system has been introduced. The old system has been marked as deprecated for 2 minor versions (1.4 and 1.5) and is now deleted since 1.6 version.

.. note::

  You can take a look at the cookbook section to practice through examples :doc:`/cookbook/import_export/index`.
