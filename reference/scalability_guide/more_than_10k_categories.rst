The number of categories will impact performances of the PIM in several ways.
We've tested performances with a set of 10k categories in total.

    We are still experiencing different issues with 10k categories and a low amount of families and attributes.

     - **[TODO]** (PIM-5239) change and save permissions on the root category of a large tree (Enterprise Edition)
