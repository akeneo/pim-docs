More than 10k categories?
-------------------------

The number of categories will impact performances of the PIM in several ways.
We've tested performances with a set of 10k categories in total.

.. warning::

    On this axis, we still have different issues. We've tested with 10k categories and a low amount of families and attributes.

    Screens impacted are the following and we're releasing performances fixes as 1.4 patches:
     - **[TODO]** (PIM-5239) change and save permissions on the root category of a large tree (Enterprise Edition)

    **If you plan to use the PIM with more than 10k categories, please contact us.**
