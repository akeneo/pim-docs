Bundles
=======

.. note::
  Since the 1.3, Akeneo PIM introduced components, they contain business logic or technical logic not coupled with Symfony Framework or Doctrine ORM / MongoDBODM, although Bundles contain the glue to assemble components together.

.. note::
  We use different namespaces, Akeneo for the technical parts not coupled with the PIM, Pim for the Community Edition parts and Enterprise postfix for the Enterprise Edition parts.
