MySQL 5.7
*********

The easiest way to install MySQL 5.7 is to use the official vendor package.

First, start by installing the `MySQL APT repository <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-apt-repo-quick-guide/en/#apt-repo-setup>`_.
It's a tool that aims to ease the installation and update of MySQL products.
During the installation of this tool, one will be asked to choose the versions of the MySQL server to install. MySQL 5.7 has to be chosen.
It's also recommended to disable all non desired tools, such as MySQL Workbench or MySQL Router.

.. code-block:: bash

    # apt install lsb-release apt-transport-https ca-certificates
    # wget -O mysql-apt-config.deb https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.7-1_all.deb
    # dpkg -i mysql-apt-config.deb

Now is the time to install what has been configured in the step before:

.. code-block:: bash

    # apt update
    # apt install mysql-server
