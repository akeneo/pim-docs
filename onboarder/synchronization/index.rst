Synchronization
===============

Push catalog structure to the retailer Onboarder
------------------------------------------------

To work, the retailer Onboarder needs some data from the PIM and you will have to push them once your installation will be done.

Data synchronized are: attribute groups, attributes, attribute option, categories, families and users.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php bin/console akeneo:synchronization:push-catalog-to-onboarder --env=prod


.. note::

    You will have to run this command only one time.
    Once the extension correctly installed, all data mentioned above will be synchronized automatically when they will be saved.


Launch the message worker
-------------------------

| The synchronization of the catalog structure and the catalog data is handled in a asynchronous way using the Google Cloud PubSub service.
| The messages that are part of the synchronization process are queued.
| The queue is consumed by a command line process called ``worker``.
|
| The worker has to be always launched as it poll the queue waiting for new messages to handle.


You want a supervised worker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the following supervisor configuration (update the following example to your needs)

.. code-block:: bash

    [program:pim-onboarder-worker]
    command=bin/console akeneo:synchronization:message:consumer --env=prod
    directory=/path/to/your/pim
    user=www-data
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true

.. note::

    Supervisor documentation: http://supervisord.org/index.html

You want an infinite worker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Launch the following command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/console akeneo:synchronization:message:consumer --ttl=-1 --env=prod

.. warning::

    This command does not ensure that the worker command line is always started
