How to upgrade to a minor version?
==================================

Each release is provided with a migration guide and a set of scripts to automate it as much as possible.

We continue to improve this process to make every new migration easier than the previous one.

Onboarder archives are available from `the Portal <https://help.akeneo.com/portal/articles/set-up-akeneo-onboarder.html#set-up-your-onboarder-instance?utm_source=akeneo-docs&utm_campaign=migration>`_.

Then, follow the migration guide located in your archive to upgrade your project.
