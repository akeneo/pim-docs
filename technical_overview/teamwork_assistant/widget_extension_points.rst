Completeness Widget
===================

Overview
________

With the Teamwork Assistant feature comes a widget in the dashboard. The goal of this widget is to display the
completeness for contributors and owner. Displayed data are contextual. It means that the completeness is not the same
for each contributor and for the owner. Contributors see completeness depending on their own permissions. The owner sees
the full completeness of family requirements.

Widget extension points?

Target zones
++++++++++++

Unlike the others, the Teamwork Assistant widget has been done with the Product Edit Form architecture, so that it is
more customizable and maintainable. It allowed us to create some extension points thanks to target zones.

You can see with this figure that the widget has three target zones to put your own extension. For example, here are the
declaration of selectors extensions:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # src/PimEnterprise/Bundle/TeamworkAssistantBundle/Resources/config/form_extensions/widget.yml
    extensions:
        teamwork-assistant-widget-project-selector:
            # The module of your extension that should be declared in a requirejs.yml file
            module: teamwork-assistant/widget/project-selector
            # Add your extension to the widget
            parent: teamwork-assistant-widget
            # Then add your extension in the target zone you want in the widget
            targetZone: top-bar-left
            # Specify the position in the target zone
            position: 100

        teamwork-assistant-widget-contributor-selector:
            module: teamwork-assistant/widget/contributor-selector
            parent: teamwork-assistant-widget
            targetZone: top-bar-left
            position: 200

Which position to choose?
 - To add your extension at the far left the position must be lower than 100.
 - To add your extension between the project selector and the contributor selector the position must be between 100 and 200.
 - To add your extension at the far right the position must be above 200.
