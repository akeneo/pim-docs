Teamwork Assistant Scalability Guide
____________________________________

For the moment, the pre-processing data are computed once you save a project, when you save a product concerned by a
project from the Product Edit Form and the sequential edit. Moreover, a command
``php app/console pimee:project:recalculate`` is provided to help you to recalculate data according to your needs.

This scalability guide will focus on how to use the Teamwork Assistant functionally (how much projects in the same time,
etc.) and technically (how to use the recalculate command) in a healthy way.
